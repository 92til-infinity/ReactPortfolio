                    a young professional looking to make the change to a hands on control of his career through effort and
                    planning. after spending years working as a salesman for a fleet company, being told a desk job was the
                    right life, i realized a cubicle was a great place to work; only if i liked my job. i decided to work on
                    building whatever i could at my cubicle that would also build me a better life. Taking a note after all
                    the
                    movies ive watched, i can build more and do more with my life from my laptop in the afternoon and reep
                    the
                    same reward as spending all day slaving away paper-pushing or building houses by coding.
